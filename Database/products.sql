(1, 'ROCCAT Vulcan TKL Linear PC Gaming Keyboard', 'TITAN SWITCH MECHANICAL (LINEAR) - Designed and built entirely by ROCCAT engineers and developed for gamers who love the feel of mechanical switches but demand a smooth and rapid actuation', 'Let\'s address the negatives. Yes, the keys can \"ping\" upon press. I don\'t care. Most of my mechanical keyboards make a lot of noise. I don\'t need silence, nor do I search for it. Go buy a Brown Cherry MX keyboard and find a product that was made for you if you don\'t like noisy switches.\n\nFor the rest of us, these Titan Opticals are fast and responsive. The rebound and response are excellent, and it feels good to type and game on. For gamers, the W keycap has a little bump like your F and J keys for re-centering without looking. Actuation happens before you bottom out like most switches and the linear is great without any feedback until you bottom out. If you need feedback on actuation, Titan Optical is not for you. Choose the Titan Tactile Mechanical or similar.\n\nFor the person that complained for the lack of dedicated media keys doesn\'t read the instructions. You can set F9-F12 dedicated to media keys as I do not use those keys on a regular basis (FN+DEL locks out only F9-F12 to media until you set it back). With the mute and volume knob it\'s great for streaming music or Youtube.\n\n\n\n\nGame mode (FN+PGDOWN) locks out windows keys like most keyboards.\n\nOverall super happy with it. The only downside (and I didn\'t take off a star) is the FN+END which turn FN into another windows key works, but you can\'t revert back without unplugging the keyboard. Considering my K65 Corsair doesn\'t even give me that option on the hardware side, I can\'t fault this bug.\n\nThe Titan Optical Switches are compatible with Cherry MX keycaps fyi as I\'ve swapped some of my Corsair keycaps just to see, but honestly the keycaps are great and I have no plans to swap them. One last note, the RGB lighting is north not south which I feel is pretty standard.\n\nSpacebar is 6.25u not 6.5u like most keyboards.', 'roccat-keyboard.jpg', '2024-01-07 15:18:09', NULL),

The Gamer Supreme series features monstrous processing power combined with the latest and greatest graphics cards to handle even the most demanding games on the market. An immense RAM allows you to easily tackle system-intensive applications such as video editing, and ensures a lag-free multitasking experience. \nWhile a bit noisy when running certain games and sometimes even using a browser, this PC does it\'s job exceptionally well. Especially over what I had been using before, a medium-end PC with parts relevant 10 years ago (AMD FX8360 CPU, RX480 GPU, etc.) this blows it out of the water and easily gets over 100 FPS (generally more) in even the most demanding games with graphics set to high, or very high/ultra. For the price, very worth it.\nGreat PC, performant, reasonably priced, amazing packaging, a couple of gifts. The PC is ready to go right after unboxing with a quick installation guide. Highly recommended!\nOverall:\nA great gaming PC, providing me consistently high framerates on HDR 1440p screens. Images have been buttery smooth, crisp, and beautiful. Even games that are commonly reviled for poor optimization issues were managing just fine. Graphic and CPU intensive games are holding up well, with the AIO CPU cooler keeping thermals well-managed around 75 Celsius under intense loads. The shipped PC has a BIOS version from September of this year, so it should be just fine for those who don\'t know how to do that.\n\nVery importantly, this PC is highly upgradeable. The AIO Cooler can handle any Intel CPU on the market with ease, and the power supply is juicy enough to spin video cards that cost more than my \'94 Honda Accord from high school. It has many storage slots and tons of space on the inside for components, and really love that vertical riser to prevent sagging/damaging the PCI slot if I ever decide to bump up the GPU to something especially beefy.', 'CyberpowerPC.jpg', '2024-01-07 15:21:01', '2024-01-07 19:04:01'),
